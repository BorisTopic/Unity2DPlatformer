# Made in collaboration with Brendan Coombs, Brandon Crosthwait, Dayson Darby, William McConnell, Chris Prescott, Brenton Randolph, Steven Sommer.

# This is our first time using Unity and our first attempt at making a video game. There was lots to learn and many challenges to overcome. Although there are still some bugs and changes that need to be made, the project came together nicely and we all learned a lot about Unity, Game Design, Teamwork and Software Engineering.
